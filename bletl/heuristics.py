    Parameters
    ----------
    x : numpy.ndarray
        Time vector.
    y : numpy.ndarray
        DO vector.
    initial_delay : float
        Hours in the beginning that are not considered.
    delay_a : float
        Hours for which condition A must be fulfilled.
    threshold_a : float
        DO threshold that must be UNDERshot for at least <delay_a> hours.
    delay_b : float
        Hours for which condition B must be fulfilled.
    threshold_b : float
        DO threshold that must be OVERshot for at least <delay_b> hours.

    Returns
    -------
    i_overshoot : int
        Index (w.r.t. inputs [x] and [y]) at which the DO peak was detected.
        `None` is returned if no peak was detected according to the given conditions.
